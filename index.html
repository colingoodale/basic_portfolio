            Technology is something that I've had waning and waxing passion for throughout my entire life. In Highschool i decided to study music in college. That was a rewarding time for me. I've certainly learned many skills when it comes to creative thought proccess and presentation. I was eamored with composition and performance. They demand two very different kinds of thinking. Composition required planning, patience, and the belief that what you heard in your head was possible to translate to other people. Performance required thinking about every note in a phrase and how to make sense of someone elses vision. Both of these disciplines required deep consideration of presentation and empathy for my audience. You must always consider the scope that your viewer is looking at you with when preparing a piece of music or any kind of art. That's the only was that you can properly translate the drama of a melody, or impart emotion into your brush strokes.

            The chapter following college has been less rewarding. While I truly develop my musical talents and ability to construct comprehensible music, I needed to find a way to provide for myself. I undertook a career in sales and have had highs and lows like I never expected. I've found that with sales, you're an isolated person. Regardless of whether you work in a team or if you're truly alone, you're alone.  You're in a position that is the least favorable in a company. However much success I've expereinced, it seems to be tainted with inner office politics and nonsense.
