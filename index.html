            <p>I have recently begun a journey to improve my career and life in general. I stumbled upon coding as a serious idea when I was considering law schools. Unlike law, design allows me to create and build while using my logical abilities.</p>
            <p>This is my portfolio and baisc info. Please check out my GitHub and other repositories; I haven't been coding long, but I have been coding a lot. You'll see some projects from my course in Full Stack Development as well as some packages that I've put together of visuals for websites.</p>
